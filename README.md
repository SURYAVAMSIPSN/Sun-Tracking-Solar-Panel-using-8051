# Sun-Tracking-Solar-Panel-using-8051
Undergrad Project for the course ECE3003 - Microcontroller. Project uses Low level language 
and circuit schematic simulation on the Proteus software to design a servo-motor and LDR 
based sun tracker prototype which faces the sun throughout the day for maximum energy extraction.
